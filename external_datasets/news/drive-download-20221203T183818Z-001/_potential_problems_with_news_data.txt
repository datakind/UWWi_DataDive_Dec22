Potential issues with the news data that should be addressed before using them to draw firm conclusions:

(1) Only one item in the dataset is classified as "food". Is this because only one headline was about food or is this due to the sampling process?

(2) The query was supposed to get data from 2017 to 2022, but in practice, almost 90% of the entries are from 2022. This indicates that we have an incomplete sample and, importantly, that even the 2022 data may not be the complete set of relevant news headlines.
